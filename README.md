# Social Grid

This is sample project for Angular v19.

## Setup project on local machine

This project is created with Angular v19 and `pnpm`, but if you're not using `pnpm`, `npm` should be sufficient.

### Run development server

```bash
pnpm start
or
ng serve
```

Then, open http://localhost:4200/ in your browser. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Run unit tests

```bash
pnpm test
or
ng test
```

### Build

```bash
pnpm build
or
ng build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist` directory.

> please not that the html and others chunk will be in dist/social-grid/browser
